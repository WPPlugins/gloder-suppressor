A plugin to suppress the new version update notice in the WordPress admin area..

== Description ==

This plugin suppresses the "There is a new version of WordPress available, please upgrade" notice in the Dashboard area of WordPress.

It is meant for use by a host or administrator who has many blogs to maintain for clients who are not neccessarily web- or tech-savvy and
worry that their blog will stop working if it is not updated straight away.

This is not to say that WordPress shouldn't be upgraded, it should be upgraded as soon as possible, but use of this plugin allows the 
administrator some breathing space from a torrent of panicky emails and allows the upgrades to be carried out a time that is suitable to him/her, 
maybe after waiting to see if any new bugs or issues arise from the new version.
